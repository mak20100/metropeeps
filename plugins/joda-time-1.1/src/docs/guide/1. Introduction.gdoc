The Joda-Time Plugin integrates the "Joda-Time":http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/ date/time library into Grails. The plugin...

* Bundles the libraries necessary to use Joda Time types as persistent fields on domain classes.
* Provides the ability to bind from form inputs to Joda Time fields on domain or command objects.
* Supports JSON and XML rendering of Joda Time types.
* Provides tag-libs for input and output of Joda Time data.
* Enhances Grails' scaffolding to support domain classes with Joda Time fields.
* Adds compatibility and consistency methods to Joda Time types so that they integrate better with Groovy.

h2. Known Issues

* In Grails 1.1.1 there is an issue with auto-timestamping using Joda Time properties. On save _GroovyRuntimeException_ is thrown with the message @"Could not find matching constructor for: java.lang.Object(java.lang.Long)"@. The workaround is to declare the fields non-lazy (GORM is mistaking them for one-to-one associations and wrapping a lazy proxy around them - see [GRAILS-4689|http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/GRAILS-4689]), e.g.

{code}
DateTime dateCreated
DateTime lastUpdated

static mapping = {
	dateCreated type: PersistentDateTime, lazy: false
	lastUpdated type: PersistentDateTime, lazy: false
}
{code}

* It is currently not possible to do certain types of criteria query with _DateTime_ properties mapped using _PersistentLocalDateTimeTZ_ (or any other multi-column Hibernate UserType). Aggregate functions (max, min, avg, count, etc.) in projections will not work on such properties and neither will the _'between'_ criterion.
